# 🏈 Football Card Collection

This is a **Football Card Collection** developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The project was created as part of the [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** curriculum.

The goal of this app is to display a collection of football player cards, reinforcing JavaScript fundamentals such as working with objects, conditionals, and array transformations.

## 🚀 Features

- Display a list of collectible football player cards  
- Styled with clean, responsive layout

## 📚 What I Learned

This project helped me apply and deepen my understanding of core JavaScript concepts:

- Creating and freezing JavaScript objects with `Object.freeze()` to prevent modification  
- Using `switch` statements for decision-making logic  
- Using `map()` to transform arrays into DOM elements  
- Manipulating the DOM dynamically based on object data  
- Structuring data collections using arrays of objects

👨‍💻 About This Project
This web app was built as an interactive exercise in the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course from [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
It helped me practice object handling, control flow, and rendering data to the web page in a scalable way.
